My short code sketchs.

Sometimes (ok, it happens very often) I want to code a new thing. 
It is often a small component, or a new (for me) method, or the best 
practice (perhaps only in my opinion:). Some components I can reuse.

In this repository I'll save these short code sketches. 

There are many bugs in this repository, please be forgiving. 
It's just my work notes.

p.s. Someday, I'll make a normal list of projects

How to run:
1. int dir /src/projects choose the project
2. run index.html
